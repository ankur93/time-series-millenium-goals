    "The results of a complex machine learning problem are meaningless unless they are put to work. This typically means a presentation to stakeholders. Even if it is a competition or a problem I am working on for myself, I still go through the process of presenting the results. It’s a good practice and gives me clear learnings I can build upon next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The template I use to present results is below and may take the form of a text document, formal report or presentation slides.\n",

    "* Context (Why): Define the environment in which the problem exists and set up the motivation for the research question.\n",
    "* Problem (Question): Concisely describe the problem as a question that you went out and answered.\n",
    "* Solution (Answer): Concisely describe the solution as an answer to the question you posed in the previous section. Be specific.\n",
    "* Findings: Bulleted lists of discoveries you made along the way that interests the audience. They may be discoveries in the data, methods that did or did not work or the model performance benefits you achieved along your journey.\n",
    "* Limitations: Consider where the model does not work or questions that the model does not answer. Do not shy away from these questions, defining where the model excels is more trusted if you can define where it does not excel.\n",
    "* Conclusions (Why+Question+Answer): Revisit the “why”, research question and the answer you discovered in a tight little package that is easy to remember and repeat for yourself and others.\n"
