    "After spot checking, itâ€™s time to squeeze out the best result from the rig. I do this by running an automated sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the top performing algorithms. I also design and run experiments using standard ensemble methods of the top performing algorithms. I put a lot of time into thinking about how to get more out of the dataset or of the family of algorithms that have been shown to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, statistical significance of results is critical here. It is so easy to focus on the methods and play with algorithm configurations. The results are only meaningful if they are significant and all configuration are already thought out and the experiments are executed in batch. I also like to maintain my own personal leaderboard of top results on a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the process of improving results involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithm Tuning: where discovering the best models is treated like a search problem through model parameter space.\n",
    "* Ensemble Methods: where the predictions made by multiple models are combined.\n",
    "* Extreme Feature Engineering: where the attribute decomposition and aggregation seen in data preparation is pushed to the limits.\n"
